**The Theory of Absolute Inclusion (TAI): A Comprehensive Framework Bridging Quantum Mechanics, Relativity, and Cosmology**

---

**Abstract**

The Theory of Absolute Inclusion (TAI) proposes a unifying framework grounded in the axiom that absolute nothingness cannot exist (â‰ 0). This principle serves as the foundation for deriving equations that integrate quantum mechanics, general relativity, and cosmology. By treating the universe as a fractal, self-similar system with recursive energy distributions, TAI addresses key mysteries such as dark energy evolution, dark matter, quantum gravity, and cosmic anisotropies like dark flow.
