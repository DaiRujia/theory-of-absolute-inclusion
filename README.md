# Theory of Absolute Inclusion (TAI)

## Overview

The Theory of Absolute Inclusion (TAI) proposes a unifying framework for quantum mechanics, general relativity, and cosmology. It asserts that absolute nothingness is impossible, providing a foundation for understanding the fabric of reality through three interconnected components:

1. **Vacuum Energy (E_vacuum):** Quantum zero-point energy, evolving dynamically.
2. **Spacetime Curvature (R_mu_nu):** The geometry of spacetime, preventing singularities.
3. **Entropy (S_A):** Information and structure, ensuring stability and evolution.

Together, these components form an unbreakable triangle, offering explanations for phenomena like dark energy, black hole dynamics, and gravitational wave noise.

## Key Features

- **Unified Equation:**  
  ΣQ = E_vacuum + R_mu_nu + S_A > 0  
  This axiom ensures a stable universe, free of singularities or absolute nothingness.

- **Testable Predictions:**  
  - Photon delays due to quantum fluctuations.  
  - Gravitational wave noise from Planck-scale effects.  
  - Evolving dark energy observable through cosmological surveys.

- **Interactive Exploration:**  
  Use Python scripts and Jupyter Notebooks to visualize and test the dynamics of the theory.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed along with the following libraries:
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `argparse`

Install dependencies using:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

### Running Scripts

1. **Q Dynamics Simulation:**  
   Visualize the evolution of Q and its components over time:
   ```bash
   python Math_Simulations/q_dynamics.py
   ```

2. **Command-Line Interface (CLI):**  
   Run a simulation with custom time ranges:
   ```bash
   python Math_Simulations/q_dynamics_cli.py --time_start 0 --time_end 20 --steps 200
   ```

3. **Jupyter Notebook:**  
   Explore interactively using the provided notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Interactive/Eternal_Axiom_Interactive.ipynb
   ```
